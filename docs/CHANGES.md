# Changes

What this project changed relative to [LAS Recomp](https://github.com/peiikai/LASRecomp) (its recompiler and Switch
runtime), why, and where. It also lists the debugging switches, the test routes, the known gaps and the next steps.
Newest work is at the bottom of each section; the commits are on `main`.

## Project setup (ae4fa76)

- **Retargeted at DOAX3 Scarlet 1.0.0** (title 01009CC00C97C000, NintendoSDK 6.4.2). The Link's Awakening specific
  code is removed (warp, mirror mode, widescreen camera, pots, pets, randomizer, save editor, extra flags).
- **Game hooks:** `runtime/hle/game_hooks.c` and `runtime/ui/game_panels.mm`. Each hook point the shared runtime calls
  answers "nothing special" until a DOAX3 counterpart is written. `game_in_play()` returns 0, because the game's
  in-play state isn't located yet.
- **Three recompiled modules** (`Makefile`: `make gen`, then `make -j16`):

  | Module | What it is | Output |
  |---|---|---|
  | `main` | the game | `generated/game` |
  | `sdk` | NintendoSDK | `generated/sdk` |
  | `subsdk0` | NVIDIA glslc, base 0x7005000000 | `generated/glslc` |

  `subsdk1` (multimedia) is not loaded; `movie::` is host code instead.
- **Tools:**
  - `tools/nsp_extract.py`: extracts exefs, romfs and control from an NSP using your own `prod.keys`. It handles a
    base game only (no update/BKTR patch support yet).
  - `tools/sym.py` and `tools/addr2sym.py`: name guest addresses.
  - `tools/run.sh [secs]`: runs the game; the log goes to `doax3.log`.

## Kernel, HLE and services (ae4fa76)

- **Fibers:** `nn::os` fibers, in `runtime/hle/fiber.c`.
- **Offline network** (`runtime/services/net.c`), as on a console with no connection:
  - nifm turns every connection request down;
  - bsd fails to create sockets;
  - ssl hands out contexts that never get used.
- **Library applets** (controller strap guide, error dialogs): skipped and logged, in `runtime/hle/applets.c`.
- **`movie::MediaData::FindRect`**, in `runtime/hle/movie.c`.
- **Ids:** the program id and the add-on content base id (0x01009CC00C97D000) are DOAX3's, in
  `runtime/kernel.c` (GetInfo) and `runtime/services/misc.c` (aoc). aoc reports no DLC: the base dump is the *Basic Free Edition*.

## Audio (`runtime/services/audio.c`)

- **ae4fa76:**
  - The audren work buffer is sized as the SDK expects.
  - Splitter routing works; voices routed through splitters were silent before.
  - The BufferMixer effect is implemented.
- **3aceb94: Aux effect (type 2)**, ported from the SDK module's own code (`nn::audio::server::AuxInfo::Update`,
  `CommandGenerator::GenerateAuxCommand`, `dsp::WriteAuxBufferDsp` / `ReadAuxBufferDsp`):
  - The effect's input goes into the send ring.
  - Its output is replaced by what the game wrote into the return ring.
  - A disabled effect resets both rings and passes the input through dry.
  - Verified: the return is the send delayed by 2400 samples, correlation ~1.0, no dropouts.

  Parameter layout:

  | Offset | Field |
  |---|---|
  | 0 | in[24] |
  | 0x18 | out[24] |
  | 0x30 | channels |
  | 0x34 | rate |
  | 0x38 | ring sample count |
  | 0x40 | send info address |
  | 0x50 | return info address |

  Ring state is at info+0x40 (read offset, then write offset); int32 samples start at info+0x80.

## Graphics: NVN on Vulkan, Maxwell shader translator (ae4fa76)

- **Shader translator** (`runtime/nvn/maxwell/translate.c`):
  - separable programs;
  - shared memory (LDS/STS);
  - image load/store (SULD/SUST);
  - stencil sampling, in compute shaders only (`ShaderKey.tex_stencil_mask`).
- **Textures** (`runtime/nvn/vulkan/textures.c`):
  - storage image views (`vk_storage_view`);
  - buffer textures (target 10, made a 1D image);
  - 32-bit integer formats viewed as float;
  - a 1x1 2D texture bound in a cube slot becomes a 1x1 cube of its texel (`cube_of_1x1`); before, it was a black dummy.
- **Present pacing:** `present_pace` in `runtime/nvn/objects.c` paces to the game's present interval (2, so 30 fps).
- **Resolution:** native 1x by default. Scaled targets broke the deferred lighting compute pass, which stores at the
  game's pixel coordinates.

## Shader preparation at startup (efffec6)

- **Problem:** LAS Recomp's preparation (build every pipeline the game used before, ahead of the game) never ran.
  - It started from LA's launcher.
  - It looked for shader code where DOAX3 doesn't keep it; DOAX3's shaders are inside its packed data archive.
- **Code store:** each stage's code is kept in `cache/shader_code/<hash>.bin` the first time the game builds it.
  This is on the player's machine only and never committed.
- **Preparation:** it runs at device init from `cache/shader_code` and `cache/shader_seen.txt`.
- **Compute records** carry their stencil slots (` st=`), so the lighting shader is prepared too.
- **Result:** a second visit to the hotel prepares 40 variants in 0.24 s, with no first-visit compiles. Before, the
  first visit skipped ~1250 draws over 2 s.

## GPU waits the game can't observe (b18b47d, `runtime/nvn/vulkan/exec.c`)

- **Problem:** DOAX3's loader copies each texture out of a staging texture and calls `nvnQueueFinish` ~350 times per
  load.
- **Fix:** the copies snapshot guest data when translated. So the game's waits (QueueFinish, SyncWait) now stop at the
  latest submission with observable work: draws, dispatches or ReportCounter.
  - `obs_seq` records that submission; `note_observable()` updates it; `observable_limit()` applies it.
- **Result:** load-screen stalls dropped from 115–240 ms to 60–110 ms.
- **Also:** `runtime/nvn/slowframe.c` can log slow frames during loads.

## Opening movie (67d7a94, `runtime/hle/movie.c`)

- **Problem:** the opening started black, then crashed on its first frame. SDK 6.4.2's movie API differs from LA's.
- **Method:** the vtable order came from resolving `subsdk1`'s `_ZTVN5movie*` relocations.
- **Extractor:** slot 2 is `SetDataSource(const char *path)`, with the path in x1.
- **Decoder:**
  - The game creates its textures and buffers on the "format changed" event (event 2). So the first video frame
    signals event 2, and output is held until the game has called `GetOutputFormat`.
  - The format includes `stride`.
  - Frames are copied as packed NV12 (Y at stride = width, then UV) into the buffer the game passes to
    `GetOutputBuffer`.
  - Slot 17, `GetOutputBuffer(int, Buffer*, MediaData*)`, is implemented.
- **Debugging aids added:**
  - `LARECOMP_TRACE_CALL` (`runtime/dispatch.c`).
  - `LARECOMP_FNPROF` now writes its profile on a crash (`runtime/fnprof.c`, `runtime/platform/windows.c`).
- **When it plays:** only on a fresh save, when the first vacation starts.

## Test routes (7443143, `tools/route.sh`)

`tools/route.sh <route> [secs] [shot frames]` runs the game with scripted input; shots go to `build/frames/`.

| Route | Save | Path | Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| `menus` | existing | title, hotel room, casino | ~160 s |
| `volleyball` | fresh | opening movie, Kasumi's arrival, Niki Beach, Beach Volleyball | ~420 s |
| `relax` | fresh | as `volleyball`, then the shower scene, evening, night | ~330 s |

Fresh-save routes move `save/` to `save.route-backup/` and put it back afterwards.

## Debugging switches (environment variables)

Added in this project:

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `LARECOMP_FENCE_ALL=1` | full GPU waits (turns off the observable-work shortcut) |
| `LARECOMP_SLOW_FRAME_ALL=1` | log slow frames during loads too |
| `LARECOMP_TRACE_CALL=<hex>` | log a guest function's arguments x0–x3 and result (first 200 calls) |
| `LARECOMP_AUX_DRY=1` | leave the Aux effect out |
| `LARECOMP_AUX_LOG=1` | Aux send/return levels every 1000 frames |
| `LARECOMP_AUX_CAPTURE=<file>` | save Aux channel 0's input and output |
| `LARECOMP_AUDIO_LEVEL=1` | output peak and RMS about once a second |
| `LARECOMP_LOG_STAGES=<n>` | the first n shaders' headers and their stages |
| `LARECOMP_SHADER_SURVEY=1` | log every unknown instruction in a shader |
| `LARECOMP_PRESENT_PACE=0` | uncapped frame rate |

Inherited from LAS Recomp and used here:

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `LARECOMP_INPUT="frame:BUTTON:frames,..."` | scripted input |
| `LARECOMP_SHOT_AT=<frames>` | screenshots at those frames, to `build/frames/` |
| `LARECOMP_COPY_TRACE=<frame>` | per-draw and per-copy trace of one frame |
| `LARECOMP_SAVE_MSL=1` | keep translated shaders in `build/glsl/` |
| `LARECOMP_FNPROF=<from>:<to>` | guest function-entry profile |
| `LARECOMP_SHADER_PREP=0` | no shader preparation at startup |
| `LARECOMP_SYNC_SHADERS=1` | compile on first use, blocking, instead of skipping draws for a few frames |

## Status (2026-10-31)

- **Plays at 30 fps at 1920x1080.** The game renders 3D at 1600x900 and the UI at 1080p.
- **Scenes checked correct:**
  - title and menus;
  - island map, hotel, casino, closet, Owner Shop;
  - beach cutscenes, relax/shower, sunset, night;
  - a full Beach Volleyball match;
  - the opening movie.
- **Performance** (RTX 3060):
  - GPU ~7 ms per frame;
  - render thread ~2 ms per frame;
  - about half a CPU core.
- **Stability:** a 10.7-minute random-input run had no crash.
- **First-visit shader pop-in** is by design (`LARECOMP_SYNC_SHADERS=1` stalls instead).

## Known gaps and next steps

- **Load stalls:** 60–110 ms remain, from render-thread deswizzling (~30 ms) and ring-slot waits.
- **`game_in_play` and level hooks** are not located, so slow-frame classification treats every frame as a load.
- **Stencil sampling in graphics stages:** not handled. None of the game's graphics shaders use it so far, and the
  translator logs it if one does.
- **Textures:** 8- and 16-bit integer formats; swkbd (software keyboard) offsets.
- **Untested:** the volleyball serve with scripted input; other activities (Beach Flags, pool).
- **Update / DLC:** only from your own console dumps (see the README). They need:
  - BKTR patch support in `tools/nsp_extract.py`;
  - recompiling the updated code;
  - aoc reporting the DLC you own and mounting its data.
